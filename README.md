This is a simple `react-native init` project with some libraries. This project includes out of the box:

* React-Native
* React-Native-Navigation
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Redux Offline
* ESlint
* Airbnb's ESlint rules

## Download

You can download this boilerplate from command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-redux-boilerplate.git
```

or you can download the releases from github's releases:

https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-redux-boilerplate/releases

## Installation

After you've downloaded RNReduxBoilerplate, go to its folder and type:

```
yarn
cd ios/ && pod install
cd .. && yarn start
```

## Description

Starting a new project can take some time to configure project structure, libraries and so on... So, I decided to make this starter kit open source for anyone who needs a little help.
